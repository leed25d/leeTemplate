We're going to build the API for a Mars rover using a test-driven
approach. Some things that the rover could do:


++    * know which compass direction it is facing  
??    * know where it is relative to its landing position  
++    * move forward  
++    * turn left and right  
++    * sense whether there is an obstacle  
++    * refuse to move forward if the path is blocked  
    * follow a list of single-character commands (f,l,r)  
++    * move backward (b)  
    * anything else you think would be interesting
